These are R markdown files from my research analyzing difference in gene expression between males and females with genetic diseases.
TTR Amyloidosis uses a t-test to compare male and female normalized gene expression levels for patients with Tranthyretin Amyloidosis.
Other Datasets is a file that runs the same analysis for various other genetic diseases.
Master Code is a file with all the generalized code to do the analysis whether on existing datasets I have done or new ones.
ATTR Random Forest Approach uses Random Forests to see of gene expression can accurately predict gender. We have found that it cannot.
Cancer Datasets RF Approach also does a RF for several of the other diseases and we are focusing right now on Lung Cancer because Gene Expression is doing a good job of predicting gender.
